## Problem Statement:
You are tasked with implementing a logging system for an application. The logging system should ensure that there is only one instance of the Logger class, which can be accessed globally across the application.

Each time the Logger logs a message, the message should be printed to the console with a timestamp. You will also implement a way to track how many log messages have been created.
